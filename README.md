# Brain-Tumor-Volumetric-Segmentation-in-Multimodal-MRI-Using-3D-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
In this work, two neural networks architectures based on the Unet network have been designed and trained to automatically segment different tumor substructures using the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) 2020 training dataset
